PHP WebSockets
==============
The PHP WebSockets code hasn't been updated in a while and is no longer compatible with all browsers.
You probably should not use it for production code.

What is it?
===========
PHP WebSockets is a PHP library that implements the WebSockets protocol.
The [WebSockets protocol](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.txt) (RFC6455) is currently being
standardized by the IETF. With WebSockets, a client (e.g.: a browser) and
a server can set up a two-way communication channel with little overhead
compared to a XMLHttpRequest or long polling.
